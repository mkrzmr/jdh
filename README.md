Despite their significance, political web defacements remain an under-utiled resource for research on both the history of activism on the web as well as subaltern political communication. Web defacements as a form of hacktivism are rarely archived and thus mostly lost for systematic study. When they find their way into web archives, it is often more as a by-product of a larger web archiving effort than as the result of a targeted campaign. Aside from large collections such as the Internet Archive, which might pick up a few hacked pages during a crawl, there also exists a small scene of community-maintained cybercrime archives that archive hacked websites, some of which are hacked in a hacktivist context and may involve web defacements. While community archives exist, no source is available to serve research needs. The data source for this section will be the publicly available attrition.org archive, combined with original pages retrieved from the Internet Archive. To unlock and make available political web defacements for research, web defacements need to be stabilized through integration into an academically usable web archive. Due to their disruptive nature, this integration effort needs to be complemented by methodological innovation. This article describes a workflow for processing, indexing and analyzing political web defacements.
